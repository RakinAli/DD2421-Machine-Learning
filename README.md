# DD2421 Machine Learning

The course is intended for both undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and related fields such as engineering and statistics The course addresses the question how to enable computers to learn from past experiences It introduces the field of machine learning describing a variety of learning paradigms, algorithms, theoretical results and applications. It introduces basic concepts from statistics, artificial intelligence, information theory and probability theory in so far they are relevant to machine learning

The following topics in machine learning and computational intelligence are covered in detail

- Nearest neighbour classifier

- Decision trees

- Bias and the trade-off of variance
  regression

- probabilistic methods

- Bayesian learning

- Support vector machines

- Artificial neural networks

- ensemble methods

- Dimensionality reduction

- Subspace methods.

Intended learning outcomes
After passing the course, the student should be able to describe the most important algorithms and the theory that constitutes the basis for machine learning and artificial intelligence

explain the principle for machine learning and how the algorithms and the methods can be used
discuss advantages with and limitations of machine learning for different applications
in order to be able to identify and apply appropriate machine learning technique for classification, pattern recognition, regression and decision problems.
